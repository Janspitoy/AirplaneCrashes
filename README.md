## Project Description

This project aims to analyze airplane crash data to understand trends, patterns, and factors influencing survivability. Using data visualization and predictive modeling, the project provides actionable insights to improve aviation safety.

## Project Goals
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardize and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore trends, identify hotspots, and visualize key insights.
- **Survivability Model**: Develop a machine learning model to predict survivability based on key factors.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Interpret the model to derive actionable insights for aviation safety.
